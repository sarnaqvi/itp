# Final Project Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Sarah Naqvi's Portfolio Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is a portfolio website to display my performances and musical compositions. 

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

Resources I plan to use include HTML resources such as the [HTML5 Cheat Sheet](https://websitesetup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/HTML-CHEAT-SHEET.png), [Structuring Content with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content). I also plan to add playable audio files with the help of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp#:~:text=The%20tag%20contains%20one,support%20the%20element). In addition I plan to use some CSS resources such as [CSS: Styling the Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Styling_the_content). 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will consist of a website that displays images such as a headshot and photos of performances I've done with list a clickable links on the side of the main page. I also plan to have a brief description on this main page. The links will open to new pages of the website and be dedicated to seperate topics such as a page for my musical compositions, and another page detailing my musical works and music cognition based research interests. I also plan to have playable audio files for certain works.  These components will be executed through the use of HTML in order to facilitate the basic structure of the website and CSS in order to create a visually appealing site. This includes smooth transitions between pages, colors, and fonts! 
## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?
No, this project is solely for this class. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I can accomplish a site that has one main page with at least one image on the page with some text.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for the project would be at least two pages to the website with at least one playable audio file, images, and text. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A best outcome for the project would be at least three playable audio files as well as a total of four pages to the website: a main page, music page, cognition page, and resume page and a performance video. In addition, there will be interesting transitons between pages. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

To accomplish the final project I will need to do research on getting the basic structure of the website set up by learning HTML, then accquire the CSS skills for visual appeal and some transitions. This week, April 7th to 13th, will be spent submitting the project proposal. Block 1, April 14th to 23rd will be spent completing the basic structure of the website and using the previosuly mentioned resources on HTML to build the basic structure without the design elements from CSS. This will serve as the basic structure and content of the website. I'll spend the first 1-3 days doing the reading and research and then I'll spend the next 4-5 days actually applying what I learned. The left over couple of days will be left to troubleshooting. Then, in Block 2, April 23rd to May 4th I will focus on elevating the basic structure and doing a bulk of the design and CSS research. At this point I expect to have interesting fonts and colors and hopefully some transitions between pages. The project should be done at the end of Block 2. This will leave 3 days before the project is due in case I need a little extra time to finish the design with CSS and gives me some leeway in case I stray slightly from the schedule. Some of the key topics I need to research is implementing  the following to a website: playable audio files, adding colors, fonts, images, and text, and transitions with the use of either HTML or CSS. I also, of course, need to do basic research on the structuring of the website with HTML.
