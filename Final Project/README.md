## Getting Started + CSS File
I started by making the index.html file and using [Dr. Rome's website](https://racheldevorah.studio) as a template. I took the code from the "about" page from Dr. Rome's webiste and started customizing from there. In order to customize the code to fit my needs, I made my own styless.css file and made sure to put it into the same folder as the index.html file. I wanted to pick my own colors and different font for my website so I used W3Schools page on [CSS Colors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php) and their page on [CSS Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp) in order to know what to fill in the code to get a beige sort of background and Lucia font. After taking care of the CSS file, I went back to the index.html file and changed the words to make sense for my own website. For this introductory about page I just wanted to have a picture of me and some text at the bottom so I followed the template and used the image tag and made sure to put the image I wanted to use within the same folder. 
## Music Tab
After completing the About page I made another html file called music.html and added it to the website folder. This page was a bit more complicated because I wanted to add a couple audio files and a video. I noticed Dr. Rome's website had some videos on the [oeuvre page](https://racheldevorah.studio/oeuvre/) so I used the code from here for some guidance. I added my link to the music html file in the navigation section, added a picture and then went on to adding the audio files using the audio controls tag that I learned about from the [W3Schools HTML Audio site](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp). I also used the [W3Schools HTML Video page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp) for help with implementing a short performance video. I uploaded the audio files and videos I wanted to use in the same website folder so they could be called on. 

### Music Tab Problems
I had some sizing problems with the video since I felt like the video was out of proportion and looked out of place in the site so I had to adjust the width and height by playing around with the dimensions and then checking them after pushing the dimension changes. 

## Resume Tab
For the resume tab I just wanted to keep it professional and simple without any pictures, just the resume. I made another resume.html file and put it in the website folder and then upated the navigation section with the link to this file. I just transferred the text from my resume to this new html file and organized it by bolding certain topics such as Summary Statement and Education and italicized certain places. I learned the italics tag from looking at the code in Dr. Rome's website. I learned the bold tag from a [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/9207-making-text-bold-in-html#:~:text=To%20make%20text%20bold%20in%20HTML%2C%20you%20can%20use%20the,the%20text%20inside%20them%20bold.) page. I think created a hyperlink to the research lab that I work in using a [W3Schools resource](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp). In order to do the list of bullets I refered to the [sample website](https://rdwrome.github.io/) in the [itp repository](https://github.com/rdwrome/261sp25/blob/main/07HTML%26CSS/README.md). I also learned the horizontal line break from another [W3Schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp). 

### Resume Tab Problems
I was unhappy with my text sizing and felt that it was too small and I wanted to have more control over the sizing so I used a [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-change-the-font-size-in-html/) page to get the tag for this. Here is the code for this...
`
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
`

## Contact Tab
For my fourth tab, I just wanted to make a simple contact page. For this page I referenced the [phone tab from Dr. Rome's website](https://racheldevorah.studio/).  I made a new contact.html file, updated the navigation section with it, and then finished off the page with a simple image and my phone number and email. 

### Contact Tab Problems
My image for this page was way too big so I just adjusted the width and height to width=400 and height=500 by using another [W3Schools resource on image sizing](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_width.asp). 

# Final Presentation Section
My project is a website called "Sarah Naqvi Portfolio". 
I figured this would be a realistic and useful final project that could be a place I can use to keep my works online. I was really inspired by Dr. Rome's website since I feel like it is more effective than simply giving someone a one page resume. This website could be a comprehensive showcase and outline of who I am and what I do. It essentially works by clicking through the pages at the top of the screen to navigate to different pages about me. It is coded using html and CSS in GitHub Pages. Advantages of the website is that it can showcase audio files of my works and videos that I think are the most valuable feature. In terms of improvements, it would have been nice to have my own domain so then I wouldn't have to give employers a website with github in the URL. This is something that I can perhaps spend money on in the future. Maybe for the future I could do a little more with the CSS style sheet and maybe do some JavaScript implementations for a more interactive experience with transitions between the pages and moving elements.
