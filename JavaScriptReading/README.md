#Java Script Reading
##Chapter Observations
###Chapter 1
Know: The order in which operators are applied is determined by their precedence with multiplication and division being applied before addition and subtraction.

Didn't know: I didn’t know that in JavaScript, values are bits that are sorted into chunks based on the pieces of information they collectively represent. There are different types of values as well (numbers, text, etc.) 

###Chapter 2
Know: The placement of a semicolon is incredibly important. Though JavaScript does not require one at the end of a statement in all cases, it is generally safer to include the semicolon in every statement that requires it. 

Didn’t Know: In order to create a loop to go back to some point in the program, the keyword “while” can be used to start a statement. After the keyword “while”,  an expression is then placed in parentheses, followed by a statement. The loop will keep entering the statement as long as the expression is “true” in Boolean. 

###Chapter 3
Know: Function binding is just assigning a name to a piece of code. 

Didn’t Know: Lexical scoping is the way in which bindings are visible based on locality. The bindings that are visible are determined by the location of that block of code in the program text since degrees of locality can be created when blocks and functions can be within other blocks and functions.
